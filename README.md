Unity-TextTyper
=========================

TextTyper is a text typing effect component for Unity. TextTyper prints out characters one by one to a uGUI Text component. Adapted by RedBlueGames from synchrok's GitHub project (https://github.com/synchrok/TypeText).

It's easy to find other examples of Text printing components, but TextTyper provides two major differences:
* Correct wrapping as characters are printed
* Support for Rich Text Tags

Features
--------
- **Define Text Speed Per Character**: ```Mayday! <delay=0.05>S.O.S.</delay>```
- **Support for uGUI Rich Text Tags**: ```<b>,<i>,<size>,<color>,...```
- **Additional delay for punctuation**
- **Skip to end**
- **OnComplete Callback**
- **OnCharacterPrinted Callback (for audio)**
