Unity-TextTyper
=========================

TextTyper is a text typing effect component for Unity. TextTyper prints out characters one by one to a uGUI Text component. Adapted by RedBlueGames from synchrok's GitHub project (https://github.com/synchrok/TypeText).

It's easy to find other examples of Text printing components, but TextTyper provides two major differences:
* Correct wrapping as characters are printed
* Support for Rich Text Tags
